# Project_03
In this project, we acted as a security engineer supporting an organization's SOC infrastructure. The SOC analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system. As the security engineering team we investigated and confirmed that newly created alerts are working. Since, the alerts are working, we then monitored live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system. Here we submit findings for appropriate analysis.
